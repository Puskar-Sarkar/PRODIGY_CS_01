# 🛡️ PRODIGY_CS_01 - Caesar Cipher Implementation  

This project is part of my **Cyber Security Internship at Prodigy InfoTech**.  
It implements the **Caesar Cipher algorithm**, a simple yet effective encryption technique, using Python.

## 🔹 About the Project  
The **Caesar Cipher** is a basic encryption algorithm that shifts each letter in a text by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. This program allows users to:  
✅ Encrypt messages with a user-defined shift value  
✅ Decrypt encoded messages back to their original form  
✅ Handle uppercase, lowercase, spaces, and special characters  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Puskar-Sarkar/PRODIGY_CS_01.git
